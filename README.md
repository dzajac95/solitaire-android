# Solitaire Android App

A simple app for playing Klondike soliataire on Android.
This is a personal project to explore some basic game development, and to provide for myself an ad-free way of playing solitaire on my phone :)

Project structure was started from the [raymob](https://github.com/Bigfoot71/raymob) template for creating Android apps using [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).
